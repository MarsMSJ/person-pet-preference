#Mar's Pet Perference Experiment
### Mario M Sarria Jr 

## Introduction

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is my first [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) app. I used [Heroku ](https://www.heroku.com/) for deployment and [Git](https://github.com/) for source control. The app attempts to guess if the person is a "dog person" or a "cat person" based on data entered from surveyed users. The app keeps track of the users guess and whether the app was successfull in guessing the user's preference.

- [Homebrew](https://Brew.sh/) 
- Git
- MacOS
- Visual Studio Code
- Google Chrome (Dev Mode)
- [RailsTutorial](https://RailsTutorial.org/) 
- [Heroku Dev Center](https://devcenter.heroku.com/) 
... 
- [Google](https://www.google.com/)
